# Chantel Findlay's Portfolio 

Welcome Everyone! My name is Chantel Findlay and I am currently a fourth year Honours Neuroscience Student at Dalhousie University. For my Neural Data Science class I have created a professional portfolio to showcase notable work that I have completed. 

## Data Analysis:
  * Here I show you how to [read in multiple files of raw data](Reading_in_data.md). 
  * Here I show you how to [separate columns of interest](Groupby.md) in a dataframe.

## Data Visulaization:
  * Here I show you how to [create a histogram](Histogram.md) using matplotlib.pyplot.
  * Here I show you how to [create a violin plot](Violin_plots.md) from a pre-made dataset using seaborn.  


## Statistical Analysis:
  * Here I show you how to [create a Two-Way ANOVA table](ANOVA_tables.md) using exemplary data. 

## Working with MRI Data:
  * Here I show you how to [apply a mask onto an MRI scan](MRI_mask.md).

## Little Bit of Fun:
  * Here I show you how to [add color to markdown cells](Adding_color_to_markdown.md).
  * Here I show you how to [make a table in markdown]().
