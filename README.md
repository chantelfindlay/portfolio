# Chantel Findlay's Portfolio 

Welcome Everyone! My name is Chantel Findlay and I am currently a fourth year Honours Neuroscience Student at Dalhousie University. For my Neural Data Science class I have created a professional portfolio to showcase notable work that I have completed. 

Here I show you how to [add color to markdown cells](Adding_color_to_markdown.md).

Here I show you how to [create a Two-Way ANOVA table](ANOVA_table.md) using exemplary data. 

Have any questions? Feel free to contact me at:

Thanks for stopping by!
