# Chantel Findlay's Portfolio 

Welcome Everyone! My name is Chantel Findlay and I am currently a fourth year Honours Neuroscience Student at Dalhousie University. For my Neural Data Science class I have created a professional portfolio to showcase notable work that I have completed. 

## Data Analysis:
  * Here I show you how to [read in multiple files of raw data](Read_in_data.md). 
  * Here I show you how to [create a violin plot](Violin_plots.md) using a pre-made dataset. 

## Statistical Analysis**:
  * Here I show you how to [create a Two-Way ANOVA table](ANOVA_table.md) using exemplary data. 

## Working with BioMedical Data:
  * Visualizing MRI Data
  * Masking 

## Working with EEG Data:
  * Grand Averages 
  * Topographic Maps

## Little Bit of Fun:
  * Here I show you how to [add color to markdown cells](Adding_color_to_markdown.md).
