In both Project 1 and 2 my groups used tables like the one below to organize the objectives of the project and the contributions each member made. This helped with organizing each member's role, and keeping track of what work has already been completed. It creates a nice clean look in any Python code and can be adapted for any topic (as you'll see below). 

Here is the raw data for creating a table in markdown. The table I created is Holiday and Date: 

<img width = '500' alt = 'Table in markdown' src = 'Table in markdown.png'>

And once placed in markdown, this is what the table looks like!

| <strong> Holiday </strong>     | <strong> Date </strong> |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| <strong> Christmas </strong>  | December 25       |
| <strong> New Years Eve </strong>  | December 31|
| <strong> Halloween </strong>  | October 31      |
| <strong> Valentines Day </strong>  | February 14     |
